	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {The driving forces in the development of SMRs are their specific characteristics. They can be deployed
incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for
countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. SMRs show the promise of significant cost reduction
through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and
reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability SMR designs and sizes are better suited for partial or
dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen
production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal
efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some SMR designs may also serve niche markets, for
example to burn nuclear waste.
Booklets on the status of SMR technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of SMR designs. This
booklet is reporting the advances in design and technology developments of SMRs of all the major
technology lines within the category of SMRs. It covers land based and marine based water-cooled reactors,
high temperature gas cooled reactors, liquid metal, sodium and gas-cooled fast neutron spectrum reactors and
molten salt reactors. The content on the specific SMRs is provided by the responsible institute or

	abstract = {Recent advances in nuclear fuel materials research, particularly on the topic of accident-tolerant fuels, have brought up potential opportunities for expanding the operating envelope of existing light water reactors. As many of the performance improvements offered by these technologies may be most fully realized by increasing fuel enrichment beyond the standard 5\% limit, this paper examines the potential reactor performance and fuel cycle performance of low-enriched uranium oxide fueled light water reactors by generically considering pressurized water reactors with 235U enrichment from 5 to 7\%. Advanced cladding, including accident-tolerant cladding, has the potential to increase fuel burnup limits related to hydrogen in the cladding that coincide with those limits associated with end-of-life reactivity. Therefore, higher enrichment will be necessary in order to realize the higher fuel burnups. This work includes evaluation of the fuel cycle length, discharge burnup, reactivity coefficients, and fuel cycle performance, including radioactive waste and environmental impact metrics per unit energy generated. The analysis was performed using the evaluation metrics from the US Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Study. The reactor performance and safety analysis show that enrichments between 5 and 7\% would have similar fuel temperature and moderator temperature coefficients. However, the soluble boron coefficient would decrease in magnitude, requiring more corrosive boric acid in the coolant or other methods of reactivity control during the fuel cycle. At these higher enrichments the maximum burnup at the rim of the fuel pellet would increase by almost a factor of two, which is expected to impact the formation of high-burnup structure in the fuel and the corresponding thermo-mechanical fuel properties. The fuel cycle performance assessment shows that increasing enrichment reduces the quantity of high-level waste disposed per unit energy generated, but it increases the natural resource requirements normalized to a gigawatt-electricity-per-year basis. Another impact is the slightly higher discharge burnup, resulting in somewhat different activity levels of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity at 100 and 100,000 years after fuel discharge. The environmental impacts—including land use, water use, carbon emission, and radiological exposure—are of the same magnitude per unit energy generated. However, the impacts are distributed differently. Less than 5\% enrichment has marginally more impact on the back-end of the fuel cycle, and greater than 5\% enrichment has marginally more impact on the front-end of the fuel cycle. Ultimately, no neutronic or reactor safety hindrances to employing light water reactor fuel with enrichments greater than 5\% are identified; given the achievable reactor performance benefits with advanced fuels, further practical exploration of increased enrichment fuel is recommended.},

	abstract = {We examine the potential fuel cycle performance of high assay low-enriched uranium fueled small light water reactors by considering several floating small reactor concepts of Russian origin with 235U enrichment at 10\%, 15\%, and 19.7\%. These enrichments are generic but representative of the reactor concepts being considered. The small reactor concepts were considered parametrically at two different power densities and neutron leakage fractions. The analysis was performed for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy using the evaluation metrics from the Evaluation and Screening (E\&S) Study. The reference reactor system in a once-through fuel cycle with an enrichment greater than 5\%, but less than 20\%, in the E\&S study is a graphite-moderated modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor (mHTGR). The neutron spectrum of an mHTGR is very different from these Russian floating small reactor concepts, which is why this analysis was conducted. The fuel cycle analysis indicates that increasing core leakage negatively impacts the natural resource requirements as well as the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity normalized to a giga-watt electric year (GWe-yr) basis. Further, we found that the 235U enrichment of the fuel and the rated core power density have limited fuel cycle performance impacts. One impact is the slightly higher discharge burnup of the de-rated power cases resulting in different spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity at 100 and 100,000 years after fuel discharge. The most significant result from the study is the observation that all the enrichment and power density cases resulted in decreased radioactivity at 100,000 years relative to the reference mHTGR example case with 15.5\%-enrichment from the E\&S study.},

	abstract = {The US Department of Energy Office of Fuel Cycle Technologies performed an evaluation and screening (E\&S) study of nuclear fuel cycle options to help prioritize future research and development decisions. Previous work for this E\&S study focused on establishing equilibrium conditionsfor analysis examples of40 nuclearfuel cycle evaluation groups (EGs) and evaluating their performance according to a set of 22 standardized metrics. Following the E\&S study, additional studies are being conducted to assess transitioningfrom the current USfuel cycle to future fuel cycle options identified by the E\&S study as being most promising. These studies help inform decisions on how to effectively achieve full transition, estimate the length of time needed to undergo transition from the current fuel cycle, and evaluate performance of nuclear systems and facilities in place during the transition. These studies also help identify any barriers to achieve transition. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fuel Cycle Options Campaign team used ORION to analyze the transition pathway from the existing US nuclear fuel cycle—the once-through use of low-enriched-uranium (LEU) fuel in thermal-spectrum light water reactors (LWRs) —to a new fuel cycle with continuous recycling ofplutonium and uranium in sodium fast reactors (SFRs). This paper discusses the analysis of the transition from an LWR to an SFR fleet using ORION, highlights the role of lifetime extensions of existing LWRs to aid transition, and discusses how a slight delay in SFR deployment can actually reduce the time to achieve an equilibrium fuel cycle.},
