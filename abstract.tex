\begin{abstract}
The \gls{DOE} has outlined two ways to produce \gls{HALEU} for advanced
reactors: enriching natural uranium and downblending high-enriched uranium. 
To understand the material requirements of enriching natural uranium to 
produce \gls{HALEU}, this 
work simulates multiple fuel cycle scenarios to compare how the type of 
advanced reactor deployed and the energy growth demand affect the 
material requirements of the transition to \gls{HALEU}-fueled reactors. Fuel 
cycle scenarios considered include a no-growth and a 1\% growth transition to 
either the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation \gls{MMR} or the X-energy Xe-100 
reactor from the 
current fleet of \glspl{LWR}. Materials of interest include the number of 
advanced reactors deployed, mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, 
and the \gls{SWU} capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the reactors.
The results of this work show that deploying the \gls{MMR} requires a higher 
average mass and \gls{SWU} capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, but 
a lower average than what is required by the current \glspl{LWR}. However, 
deploying the \gls{MMR} causes periods of large increases of enriched 
uranium mass and required \gls{SWU} capacity that is not present when 
deploying the Xe-100 reactor.
