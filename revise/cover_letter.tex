Dr. Fanny Courtin\\
Editor, EPJ-N \\

Dear Dr. Courtin,

Please find enclosed a revised manuscript entitled: "Enrichment dynamics 
for advanced reactor HALEU support" which I and my co-authors are 
submitting for exclusive consideration for publication as an article 
in EPJ-N. 

This revised manuscript investigates and compares the front-end requirements
for multiple transitions to advanced reactors fueled by High Assay Low Enriched 
Uranium (HALEU). We simulated each fuel cycle using the open source fuel cycle 
simulator Cyclus, and compared each transition based on the number of advanced 
reactors that must be deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the 
advanced reactors, and the calculated Separative Work Unit capacity required 
to enrich the uranium for the advanced reactors. This work informs on these 
requirements to understand how the needs of deploying these advanced reactors 
can best be met. 


Thank you for your consideration of this work. I expect the work to be 
of interest to a broad readership concerned with fuel cycle modeling and 
the transition to advanced reactors in the United States. Please 
address correspondence concerning this manuscript to me at the University 
of Illinois.
