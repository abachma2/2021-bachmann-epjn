Transitioning to High Assay Low Enriched Uranium-fueled reactors will
alter the material requirements of the current nuclear fuel cycle, in 
terms of the mass of enriched uranium and Separative Work Unit capacity.  
This work simulates multiple fuel cycle scenarios using \Cyclus to compare 
how the type of 
the advanced reactor deployed and the energy growth demand affect the 
material requirements of the transition to High Assay Low Enriched 
Uranium-fueled reactors. Fuel 
cycle scenarios considered include the current fleet of Light Water Reactors 
in the U.S. as well as a no-growth and a 1\% growth transition to 
either the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor 
or the X-energy Xe-100 reactor
from the current fleet of U.S. Light Water Reactors. This work explored 
parameters of interest including the number of 
advanced reactors deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, 
and the Separative Work Unit capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the 
reactors. Deploying Micro Modular Reactors requires a higher 
average mass and Separative Work Unit capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, 
and a lower enriched uranium mass and a higher Separative Work Unity capacity 
than required to fuel Light Water Reactors before the transition. Fueling 
Xe-100 reactors requires less enriched uranium and Separative Work Unit capacity
than fueling Light Water Reactors before the transition.
