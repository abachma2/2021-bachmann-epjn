There are two primary ways to produce \gls{HALEU} 
for advanced
reactors: enriching natural uranium and downblending high-enriched uranium. 
To understand the material requirements of enriching natural uranium to 
produce \gls{HALEU}, this 
work simulates multiple fuel cycle scenarios to compare how the size of the
advanced reactor deployed and the energy growth demand affect the 
material requirements of the transition to \gls{HALEU}-fueled reactors. Fuel 
cycle scenarios considered include a no-growth and a 1\% growth transition to 
either a microreactor fleet or a small modular reactor fleet from the 
current fleet of Light Water Reactors.The Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation 
\gls{MMR} and X-energy Xe-100 were chosen to represent the microreactor 
and small modular reactors, respectively. Materials of interest include 
the number of 
advanced reactors deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, 
and the \gls{SWU} capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the reactors.
This work shows that deploying the \gls{MMR} requires a higher 
average mass and \gls{SWU} capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, but 
a lower average than the current Light Water Reactors. 
However, 
deploying the \gls{MMR} causes periods of large increases of required 
enriched uranium and \gls{SWU} capacity that are not present when 
deploying the Xe-100 reactor.
