\section*{Review General Response}
We would like to thank the reviewers for their detailed assessment of this
paper. Your comments have resulted in changes which certainly improved the
paper.


\section*{Reviewer 1}
\begin{questions}

        %---------------------------------------------------------------------
        \question This paper look at a original problem et gives some 
        interesting insight allowing to reveal specific problems to be resolved, 
        notably the peak in SWU needed with the new HTGRs. However in its 
        current form it does not really explore the consequences of the problem 
        and does not gives any indication of direction suitable to solve this 
        problem which makes it quite lacking in valuable new information.
        In this current form the interest of the paper is limited, but if this 
        consequences and ideas for potential solutions would greatly increase 
        the interest of this paper. The main point that would profit for this 
        kind of work is the peak of SWU demand during the simulation wwith MMR 
        and Xe-100. In the simulation presented, huge peak of SWU are scattered 
        in the middle of time period where the demand is far lower. This kind of 
        peak seems to ask for a massive oversizing of the enrichment facilities 
        that would be industrially unrealistic. This difficulty should be 
        aknowledged in the paper. Some remediation technic to decrease the 
        size of the enrichment facility and increase its utilization rates seems 
        possible :
        \begin{itemize}
                \item preparing some of the fuel in advance to smooth the production
                \item downblend HEU during the peak of demand 
        \end{itemize}
        The paper should aknowledge them and explain why they are adapated or 
        not in the considered situation and what are the obstacle for their 
        implementation in the simulation.
        \begin{solution}
                
        \end{solution}

        %---------------------------------------------------------------------
        \question The second discussion option would also address another problem 
        with the paper : downblending of HEU into HALEU is mentionned quite a lot 
        in the introduction of the paper and is presented as a mean to decrease 
        the need in enrichment but is never mentionned in the part about the actual 
        simulation work. This disconnection make the introduction feel out of place.
        I recommend either discuss more how downblending of HEU can help in the 
        situation considered or remove the mentiong about downblending in the 
        introduction.
        \begin{solution}
                
        \end{solution}
        
        %---------------------------------------------------------------------
        \question Finally, a more comestic remark, the inclusion of the figures inside the main body of the paper would greatly help the readability.

        \question Review comment 2
        \begin{solution}
        	Changes for review comment 2

\section*{Reviewer 2}
\begin{questions}
        %---------------------------------------------------------------------
        \question In order to improve the comparisons, I suggest to add 
        cumulative values and to compare the 5 scenarios together via dedicated 
        figures.
        \begin{solution}
                
        \end{solution}

        %---------------------------------------------------------------------
        \question More information on the reactors design may also be useful 
        for the readers.
        \begin{solution}
                
        \end{solution}

        %---------------------------------------------------------------------
        \question Maybe adding a description of the CYCLUS code and of the way 
        the Systems have been modeled on it (e.g. preparation of appropriate 
        neutronic data, e.g. effective XS, etc.) can also be useful.
        \begin{solution}
                
        \end{solution}
